## Marketing Goals - 2020
The three high-level goals of the .NET Foundation Marketing Committee are:
- Increase membership in the .NET Foundation
- Generate awareness of .NET open source and the .NET Foundation itself
- Foster and grow an open community around .NET

The committee has discussed the following activities we want to prioritize in 2020 that align to these goals.

- Organize our calendar (and keep it organized) with events/moments we can socialize
- Create impactful marketing content to carry open message
    - Organize Information Architecture on website & fill gaps (*done*)
    - Enable our members to get content/news and create/contribute to it by driving awareness of [newsletter contributions](https://github.com/dotnet-foundation/newsletter) and [content submission & amplification](https://github.com/dotnet-foundation/content) as well as contributing to our other social channels (i.e. YouTube, Facebook, etc.) (*amplification/social processes = complete, content creation=in-progress*)
    - Arm our members with [.NET Foundation positioning & messaging](https://dotnetfoundation.sharepoint.com/:p:/s/Marketing/EbxGONyybLRMoe6MgPNUEi4BdDuEWNLmdfV_s8INO9nWTw?e=mImEov) so we have one voice when we talk about the .NET Foundation (*regular blurb in newsletter*)
    - Get project-specific swag in the [Store](https://store.dotnetfoundation.org) *(need budget)*
    - Create .NET brand book and release to community *(.NET done, .NET Foundation next)*
- Define [marketing activity proposal process](proposals.md) for our members to secure funds and drive initiatives *(in progress)*
- Drive membership through our partner members (co-marketing, PR, etc.) *(always on)*
- Prioritize sponsorships and define application process for events *(stalled)*
- Partner with Outreach committee to reach more diversity *(in progress)*
